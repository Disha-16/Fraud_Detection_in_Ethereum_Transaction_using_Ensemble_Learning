# Fraud_Detection_in_Ethereum_Transaction_using_Ensemble_Learning
 The project represents a significant advancement in protecting the Ethereum ecosystem and shows how ensemble learning can be used to address the challenges associated with detecting financial fraud.
 We ensure the robustness and generalizability of our approach by painstakingly assembling a balanced dataset derived from real Ethereum transactions, which includes a wide range of both legitimate and fraudulent cases. The ensemble approach uses a variety of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier by using stacking or weighted voting strategies to maximise their collective decision-making capacity. Our findings demonstrate a notable enhancement in the detection of fraudulent transactions, surpassing conventional single-model methods in relation to accuracy, recollection, and F1 score.
